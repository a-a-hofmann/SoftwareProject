**** facebook_topology.py ****

	This is a custom version of facebook_topology.py.
	When the network start it auto generates a constant 
	stream of random traffic from h1/h2/h3 to h18.
	After a while (30 min or more) the stream might end.



	facebook_topology.py should be moved to
		/home/mininet/mininet/custom


**** test.sh ****
	
	facebook_topology.py uses test.sh to generate traffic.

	
	test.sh should be moved to 
	/home/mininet
